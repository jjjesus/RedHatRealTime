He went on to note that Novell's latest offering actually uses technology originally developed by Red Hat.

"With their latest release, Novell has moved to the Red Hat-developed real-time patch set," Che said. "If you look at it from a technology standpoint, Novell has moved to a version aligned with what Red Hat is doing. It validates our approach that you have to work with the upstream Linux kernel."

At the London launch of MRG, line of business VP Scott Crenshaw said that the Utah-based rival had used beta versions of Red Hat's code in its offering. "They haven't contributed a line of code", he said. As a result of this change of code, he argued that "all their prior users are cut off" from previous versions.

Real time kernel work by Ingo Molnar of Red Hat
http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3627831

Red Hat MRG is a clustering product intended for integrated high-performance computing (HPC). The acronym MRG stands for "Messaging Realtime Grid".

Red Hat Enterprise MRG replaces the Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL, a Linux distribution developed by Red Hat, kernel in order to provide extra support for real-time computing, together with middleware support for message brokerage and scheduling workload to local or remote virtual machines, grid computing, and cloud computing.[55]

As of 2011, Red Hat works with the Condor High-Throughput Computing System community and also provides support for the software.[56]

The Tuna performance-monitoring tool runs in the MRG environment.[57]




Concurrent
-----

RedHawk Linux user-level commands, utilities and system administration are fully compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Ubuntu. RedHawk achieves its superior real-time performance by integrating the latest official release from kernel.org with key open source patches and kernel enhancements developed by Concurrent. RedHawk user libraries provide access to value-add features that are not part of other Linux offerings. RedHawk is fully compatible with standard Linux user level APIs, thus Linux applications written for other Linux distributions will run on RedHawk without modification.

RedHawkís Architect is a powerful tool with an easy-to-use GUI that lets a developer choose the Linux and application modules to be included in RedHawk target images. Designed especially for embedded applications, users can select as few or as many packages as desired from many different package groups. Architect allows the file system to be customized and minimized for diskless operation using flash. 



Real-time Linux

https://lwn.net/Articles/146861/

The PREEMPT_RT patch of the Linux kernel is actually a set of patches developed by a group
of kernel developers. The project was started by Ingo Moln·r and the first release was based on
kernel version 2.6.11 (March 2005). The goal of this project is to trade the throughput of the system
with low latencies and predictability, while maintaining the single-kernel approach, to allow the
developers to easily write (user-space) real-time applications.

https://lwn.net/Articles/572740/

The original realtime patches came about due to a contract that IBM and Red Hat had with the US Navy

Thomas Gleixner

 Red Hat pays him to work half-time on realtime development and it pays the messaging, realtime, and grid (MRG) team to test and productize the realtime patch set. Beyond that, there are a few other contributors, including McKenney for read-copy-update (RCU) development as well as Hart and Gortmaker. Both of the latter two indicated they would try to encourage their employers (Intel and Wind River, respectively) to contribute more to realtime development moving forward.

Concurrent releases RedHawk Linux 2.1
[Posted April 28, 2004 by corbet]
Concurrent has announced the availability of Red Hawk Real-Time Linux 2.1. "Concurrent's refinements include kernel-level priority inheritance support, a Frequency Based Scheduler (FBS), process and IRQ shielding extensions, user-level real-time Hyper-Treading control for Intel Xeon platforms, user-level spin locks, significant real-time performance tuning and many additional improvements." We have sent them a query as to when they will release source for their kernel enhancements - which certainly fall under the GPL - but have not yet received a response.

They don't *have* to release source code to the world, just to those they give binaries to. They can't restrict further redistribution, see the GPL.

Of course, it is nice gesture to make the source freely available to the world.

They do not have to release source to the world, but, they certainly do have the obligation to make source available to those to whom they're distributing these customized Linux kernels.

The company seems to be very quiet on these obligations, to judge from their web site. I think it's entirely appropriate that they get some scrutiny from the folks whose code they've customized.

Feature from Concurrent Red Hawk we don't use
-----

The affinity of cores, LLC, and memory within a domain are expressed using the usual NUMA affinity parameters to the OS, which can take SNC domains into account in scheduling tasks and allocating memory to a process for optimal performance.



A realtime preemption overview
-----
https://lwn.net/Articles/146861/

The key point of the PREEMPT_RT patch is to minimize the amount of kernel code that is non-preemptible, while also minimizing the amount of code that must be changed in order to provide this added preemptibility. In particular, critical sections, interrupt handlers, and interrupt-disable code sequences are normally preemptible. The PREEMPT_RT patch leverages the SMP capabilities of the Linux kernel to add this extra preemptibility without requiring a complete kernel rewrite. In a sense, one can loosely think of a preemption as the addition of a new CPU to the system, and then use the normal locking primitives to synchronize with any action taken by the preempting task.


Read-copy update (RCU) is a synchronization mechanism that was added to the Linux kernel in October of 2002. RCU achieves scalability improvements by allowing reads to occur concurrently with updates. In contrast with conventional locking primitives that ensure mutual exclusion among concurrent threads regardless of whether they be readers or updaters, or with reader-writer locks that allow concurrent reads but not in the presence of updates, RCU supports concurrency between a single updater and multiple readers. RCU ensures that reads are coherent by maintaining multiple versions of objects and ensuring that they are not freed up until all pre-existing read-side critical sections complete. RCU defines and uses efficient and scalable mechanisms for publishing and reading new versions of an object, and also for deferring the collection of old versions. These mechanisms distribute the work among read and update paths in such a way as to make read paths extremely fast. In some cases (non-preemptable kernels), RCU's read-side primitives have zero overhead.

The thinking behind original RT Linux

https://lwn.net/Articles/143323/

Explains shielding in this section: 7.  Migration Within OS

Some (but not all!) of
the CPUs are designated as realtime CPUs.  If a task running on a
realtime CPU executes a trap or system call that contains non-deterministic
code sequences, the task is migrated to a non-realtime CPU to complete
execution of the trap or system call, then migrated back.  This prevents
any non-realtime execution of a given realtime task from interfering
with that of other realtime tasks.

The origin of Red Hat Real Time
-----
https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/real-time-kernel

From RHEL 7 onward, the MRG product was deprecated, and  "RHEL for Real-Time" was introduced as a separate product.

 It is an optimized kernel designed to maintain low latency, consistent response time, and determinism. By way of comparison, a standard RHEL kernel focuses on throughput-oriented operations and fair scheduling of tasks. The real-time kernel is also known as kernel-rt or preempt-rt.
 
Some important kernel-rt mechanisms include:

A task's priority is checked (1-99) under heavy load.
High priority (99) tasks are given preference for CPU execution.
Does not use the Completely Fair Scheduling (CFS) policy.
Scheduling policies in-use are SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR.
Maintains low latency execution time.
Offers an opportunity to measure, record, and configure response time.

Kexec and vmcore - Installation and configuration are the same as standard RHEL.
Third-party modules - All modules must be recompiled with kernel-rt before being used.
irqbalance daemon - Disabled by default.
Scheduling policy - Only SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR is used.
Interrupt (IRQs) - Uses dedicated CPUs to isolate processes from each other.

This rt-setup package is responsible for configuring and running the rt-entsk daemon, which prevents IPI generation and delay of real-time tasks.

The following bullet points display some of the key features of rt-setup (v2.0-6):

Creates real-time groups.
Adds real-time limits configuration for PAM.
Adds /usr/bin/rt-setup-kdump to configure kdump in RT.
Adds udev-specific rules for threaded irqs and /dev/rtc access.
Adds /usr/bin/slub_cpu_partial_off to turn off cpu_partials in SLUB.
Adds net-socket timestamp static key daemon (rt-entsk).

The RT Path
-----
https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2013/03/intro-to-real-time-linux-for-embedded-developers/
When embedded projects call for for a real-time operating system, Linux developers often turn to PREEMPT-RT, the real-time kernel patch, to get it done.

‚ÄúThe PREEMPT_RT patch (aka the -rt patch or RT patch) makes Linux into a real-time system,‚Äù said Steven Rostedt, a Linux kernel developer at Red Hat and maintainer of the stable version of the real-time Linux kernel patch.

With unbounded latencies comes non-deterministic behavior.

For example, with unfair reader writer locks, where the writer has to wait for there to be no readers before it can take the lock. Because new readers can continually take the lock at any time while the writer is waiting, the writer may never get the lock. This is a prime example of an unbounded latency on the writer.

A bounded latency is the fair reader writer lock, where new readers will block if there‚Äôs a writer waiting. This way the writer has to wait for at most a fixed number of readers (at most one per CPU minus the one the writer is on).

There‚Äôs also the case of priority inversion, but I covered that in my talk at ELC,

The biggest change still outside of mainline is the conversion of spin_locks into mutexes. That changes a lot of assumptions about spin_lock side effects. For example, they no longer disable preemption. There‚Äôs some code in the kernel that assumes that.
